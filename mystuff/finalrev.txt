joint pmf = pXY(x,y) = P(X = x and Y = y)
marginal pmf = pY(y) = P(Y = y) = sum of all pXY(x,y') when y' = y
^^ both discrete


vv cdf for both discrete and continuous

joint cdf = FXY(x,y) = P(X <= x and Y <= y)
page 258: 5 rules
- x1,-inf = 0; -inf, y1 = 0; inf, inf = 1;
marginal cdf = FX(x) = FXY(x, inf)
			 = FY(y) = FXY(inf, y)


joint cdf of 2 continuous random vars:
FXY(x,y) = integral from -inf to x of
			the integral from -inf to y of
				fXY(x',y')dydx

fXY(x,y) = d^2 FXY(x,y) / dxdy

marginal pdfs
fX(x) = integral from -inf to inf of fXY(x,y) dy

independence of 2 RV if

	discrete: joint pmf = product of individual marginal pmfs
	continuous: joint pdf = product of individual marginal pdfs
	joint cdf = product of individual marginal cdfs
